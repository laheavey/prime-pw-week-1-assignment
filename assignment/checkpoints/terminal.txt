# 1 - What is the command for listing the files in the current folder (directory)?
ls

# 2 - What is the command for changing directories?
cd

# 3 - What is the command for going "up" a folder (to a parent directory)?
cd ..

# 4 - What is a quick way to create a new folder?
mkdir (+ the new folder name, without parentheses)

# 5 - What output would you expect when you run the command 'ls' in an empty folder? What about a folder containing files?
In an empty folder, I would expect the line to repeat itself - there aren't any folders/files so nothing shows up.
If the folder did have additional folders/files, the 'ls' command would list them out. 

# 6 - What is a quick way to create a new file?
touch (+ the new file name, without parentheses)

# 7 - Run 'git --version' in your terminal. What is the output?
git version 2.37.1

# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?
I'd run 'git status' to see what files I'd modified/created, and if they'd been staged or committed to GitHub.

# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?
'Git add .' stages a file, so it's ready to be committed.

# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?
git push origin main
